Code of Conduct

The code of conduct sets forth the standards of behavior expected from all employees, contractors, and representatives of the company. It reflects our core values and guides our interactions with colleagues, customers, partners, and the broader community. By adhering to this code, we foster a respectful, inclusive, and productive work environment.

Employees are expected to act with integrity and professionalism. This includes being honest, keeping promises, and following through on commitments. We do not tolerate lying, cheating, or fraud. Ethical decision‑making should guide all actions, even when faced with difficult choices. When in doubt, employees should consult with their manager or the ethics office.

Respect for others is fundamental. Employees must treat everyone with courtesy, dignity, and kindness. Harassment, bullying, discrimination, and abusive language are not tolerated. We embrace diversity and value different perspectives. Conflicts should be addressed constructively and promptly, using approved conflict resolution channels.

Compliance with laws and regulations is mandatory. Employees must adhere to applicable laws, industry standards, and internal policies. Violations may expose the company and individuals to legal penalties. If employees become aware of unlawful or unethical conduct, they must report it promptly through the appropriate channels.

Protecting company assets, including physical property, information, and intellectual property, is the responsibility of every employee. We must use resources for legitimate business purposes and avoid waste or misuse. Confidential information must be safeguarded and shared only with authorized individuals. Data security practices should be followed at all times.

The code of conduct applies inside and outside the workplace. Off‑duty behavior that negatively impacts the company’s reputation or employee relationships may also be subject to disciplinary action. Social media posts, public statements, and personal activities should reflect our values and not harm the company.

Managers are responsible for communicating the code of conduct, leading by example, and ensuring compliance. Violations of the code should be addressed consistently, with appropriate corrective actions. By living our values every day, we build trust with our stakeholders and create a workplace where everyone can thrive.
