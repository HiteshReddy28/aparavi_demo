Travel Expense Policy

The company travel expense policy outlines the procedures and rules for incurring and reimbursing business travel costs. Our objective is to enable employees to travel safely and comfortably while exercising prudent cost management. This policy applies to all employees, contractors, and consultants who travel on behalf of the company.

Pre‑approval is required for all business travel. Before booking transportation or lodging, employees must submit a travel request form specifying the purpose of the trip, estimated expenses, and dates. The employee’s manager or department head must approve the request. Unapproved travel expenses may not be reimbursed.

Air travel should be booked at the lowest available economy fare that meets business requirements. Employees are encouraged to use the company’s preferred travel agency or online booking system to ensure compliance with negotiated rates. Business class or premium economy seating requires prior approval and may be granted only for flights longer than six hours or for employees with medical conditions.

Lodging should be booked at moderately priced hotels that offer corporate rates. Travelers should compare rates and choose accommodations that balance cost and proximity to the business destination. Upgrades to suites or executive floors are not reimbursable unless required for business purposes and approved in advance.

Meal expenses are reimbursable according to per diem rates established by the company. Employees must obtain itemized receipts for meals and may not include alcoholic beverages unless entertaining clients or partners, in which case moderate consumption is permitted with manager approval. Tips for service personnel should be reasonable and customary.

Ground transportation expenses, including taxis, rideshares, public transit, and car rentals, are reimbursable when necessary. Employees should choose the most cost‑effective option available and avoid unnecessary upgrades. Car rentals must be compact or mid‑size unless larger vehicles are required for transporting equipment or multiple passengers.

Employees must submit expense reports within 30 days of completing their trip. Expense reports should be accurate, complete, and accompanied by original receipts. Failure to submit timely expense reports may result in denial of reimbursement. Employees are responsible for reconciling any advances or corporate credit card charges.

The misuse of travel funds, falsifying receipts, or claiming personal expenses as business expenses is strictly prohibited and may result in disciplinary action, including termination of employment. The company reserves the right to audit travel expenses and adjust policies as needed.
