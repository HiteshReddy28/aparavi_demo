Remote Work Policy

The remote work policy outlines the guidelines and expectations for employees who work from home or other remote locations. Our goal is to provide flexibility while maintaining productivity, collaboration, and data security. This policy applies to all employees who have been approved for remote work arrangements, whether on a full‑time or partial basis.

Eligibility for remote work depends on the nature of the job, performance history, and management approval. Employees must have a suitable workspace free from distractions and equipped with reliable internet, telephone, and necessary hardware. Managers and human resources reserve the right to reassess eligibility if performance or conduct issues arise.

Communication is critical in a remote work environment. Employees are expected to be available during core business hours, respond promptly to messages, and attend scheduled meetings via video conferencing. Teams should use collaboration tools such as chat platforms and shared calendars to coordinate work and maintain transparency.

Remote workers must adhere to information security protocols. This includes using company‑approved devices with updated antivirus software, connecting to company systems via secure VPNs, and safeguarding confidential information. Employees should lock screens when away from their workstation and avoid using public Wi‑Fi for sensitive work.

Home offices should meet ergonomic and safety standards. Employees are responsible for maintaining a tidy and hazard‑free workspace. The company may provide equipment such as monitors, keyboards, or ergonomic chairs upon request. Employees should follow proper lifting techniques and take regular breaks to reduce strain.

Productivity and accountability remain the same as in the office. Managers and employees should set clear goals, deadlines, and deliverables. Performance will be evaluated based on results rather than hours spent online. Any deviations from expected productivity should be addressed promptly through open communication.

The company reserves the right to modify or terminate remote work arrangements as business needs change. Employees should be prepared to return to the office if requested. Remote work is a privilege and not an entitlement; it requires mutual trust and responsibility.
