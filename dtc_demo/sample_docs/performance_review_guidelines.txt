Performance Review Guidelines

Performance reviews are an essential part of the company’s talent management strategy. They provide an opportunity for managers and employees to discuss achievements, challenges, and goals. These guidelines outline the process for conducting fair and constructive performance evaluations.

Reviews are conducted annually, with mid‑year check‑ins to assess progress. Managers should prepare by reviewing the employee’s job description, past goals, and performance metrics. Feedback should be based on observable behaviors and measurable outcomes, not personal opinions or assumptions.

The review meeting should be a two‑way conversation. Managers are expected to highlight accomplishments, recognize contributions, and discuss areas for improvement. Employees should be encouraged to self‑assess and share their perspectives on their performance, challenges, and professional development needs.

Goals should be SMART: Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time‑bound. Managers and employees collaboratively set goals aligned with department objectives and company strategy. Goals should challenge employees to grow while remaining attainable with reasonable effort and resources.

Constructive feedback should be balanced and actionable. When addressing performance gaps, managers should provide specific examples, discuss the impact on the team or company, and suggest ways to improve. Feedback should focus on behaviors that can be changed rather than personal characteristics.

Managers should document the performance review in the company’s human resources system. Documentation should include the employee’s achievements, feedback, agreed‑upon goals, and any development plans. Employees should sign the review to acknowledge that it has been discussed. They may provide written comments if they disagree with any points.

Managers are responsible for supporting employees after the review. This includes providing coaching, training opportunities, and resources needed to achieve goals. Follow‑up meetings should be scheduled to monitor progress. Performance issues that require immediate improvement should be addressed promptly and not wait until the annual review.

Performance reviews help align individual contributions with the company’s mission and values. They foster communication, build trust, and drive continuous improvement. By adhering to these guidelines, managers can conduct fair and effective evaluations that motivate employees and support career growth.
