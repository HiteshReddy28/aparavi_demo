Conflict of Interest Policy

A conflict of interest occurs when an employee’s personal interests interfere with, or appear to interfere with, the interests of the company. Our conflict of interest policy aims to maintain transparency, trust, and integrity by outlining the behaviors that may create conflicts and establishing procedures for disclosure and management.

Employees must avoid situations that could compromise their judgment or objectivity. Examples of conflicts include personal financial interest in a vendor, accepting gifts that could influence decision‑making, or engaging in outside employment that competes with the company’s business. Even the perception of a conflict can damage reputations and erode trust.

Employees are required to disclose any potential or actual conflicts to their manager or the ethics committee. Disclosure should occur as soon as the conflict arises or is anticipated. Managers and the ethics committee will review the disclosure, determine whether a conflict exists, and decide on appropriate measures to mitigate it.

The company may require employees to recuse themselves from decision‑making, divest conflicting interests, or terminate outside engagements that conflict with their duties. Failure to disclose conflicts or deliberately hiding them may result in disciplinary action up to and including termination.

Gifts, entertainment, or favors offered by suppliers, clients, or other third parties should be declined if they could influence or appear to influence business decisions. Acceptable tokens of nominal value may be accepted, but employees must report them to their manager. Large gifts or monetary equivalents are strictly prohibited.

Employees must not use company assets or information for personal gain or for the benefit of family members or friends. Misuse of confidential information, intellectual property, or trade secrets is a serious violation of company policy and may lead to legal action.

By following this conflict of interest policy, employees help maintain an ethical and transparent work environment. Open communication and full disclosure are essential to managing conflicts effectively. Managers should lead by example and foster a culture of integrity and accountability.
