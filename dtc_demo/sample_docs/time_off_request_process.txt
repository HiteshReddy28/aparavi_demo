Time Off Request Process

The time off request process provides employees with a clear and consistent method for requesting vacation, personal time, sick leave, and other types of absence. By following this process, employees and managers can plan ahead, ensure adequate coverage, and maintain an accurate record of leave balances.

Employees must submit their time off requests through the company’s human resources management system at least two weeks in advance for planned absences. The request should specify the type of leave, start and end dates, and any relevant notes. For unplanned absences such as illness, employees should notify their manager as soon as possible and update the system once they return.

Managers are responsible for reviewing and approving or denying time off requests in a timely manner. They should consider staffing needs, workload, and fairness when making decisions. Conflicting requests should be resolved by prioritizing employees who submitted earlier or by seeking voluntary adjustments among the team. If necessary, managers may deny requests due to operational requirements but should work with employees to find alternative dates.

The company observes a number of designated holidays that do not require a time off request. Employees should consult the holiday calendar and plan their leave accordingly. Floating holidays or personal days must still be requested through the system.

Leave balances are tracked automatically in the HR system. Employees are responsible for monitoring their balances and ensuring they have sufficient leave available. Taking time off without available balance may result in leave without pay, subject to manager approval.

Extended leaves, such as parental leave or medical leave, require additional documentation and approval from HR. Employees should consult the respective policies and begin the request process as early as possible. HR will assist with paperwork, benefits coordination, and legal compliance.

By following this time off request process, employees can enjoy their leave while ensuring that business operations run smoothly. Managers and employees should communicate openly about upcoming absences and plan coverage accordingly. Time away from work is important for employee well‑being and helps maintain a healthy work‑life balance.
